# 📊 LLM EDA Powered Data Analysis using Gradio App

This project leverages the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Gradio** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** interactively and intelligently. The application allows users to upload CSV files and automatically generate insights, visualizations, and statistical summaries—making data exploration easier and more intuitive than ever before.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📁 Upload your own dataset (.csv format)
* 🧠 LLM-generated descriptive analysis of the dataset
* 📉 Automatic visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc.)
* 🧪 Statistical summaries (mean, median, correlation, etc.)
* 🖼️ Clean and interactive UI powered by **Gradio**
* 🐍 Developed in **Python** using popular libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `openai` or similar LLM integration

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Frontend/UI:** Gradio
* **Backend:** Python
* **Libraries Used:**

  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * openai / transformers / langchain (based on LLM integration)
  * gradio

---

## 📝 How It Works

1. Upload a `.csv` dataset using the Gradio UI
2. The app reads and preprocesses the dataset
3. An LLM is prompted to describe:

   * Dataset structure
   * Missing values
   * Data types
   * Relationships & patterns
4. Visuals and insights are rendered in real-time

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-eda-gradio.git
cd llm-eda-gradio
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

---

## 📁 Sample Dataset

A sample dataset is included (`titantic_data.csv`) for quick testing.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

* Thanks to OpenAI / HuggingFace for LLM APIs
* Gradio team for enabling quick UI deployment
* Inspired by the growing need for no-code/low-code data analysis tools
